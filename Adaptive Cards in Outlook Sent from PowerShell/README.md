    Hello there! I’m **Morten Mynster**, an automation enthusiast, coder, and proud family man. My IT journey began back in 2017, and since then, I’ve been on a mission to simplify the complex through scripting and automation. Whether it’s crafting workflows, managing systems, or experimenting with new technologies, I thrive on turning challenges into opportunities for innovation.

When I’m not writing code or tinkering in my homelab, I’m spending time with my amazing wife, our kid (soon to be two!), and our Disney-inspired dog, Mushu (yes, like the dragon from *Mulan*). Outside of work, you’ll find me gaming, exploring new ideas, or enjoying quality time with my family.

### What I Work On
I dedicate my time to mastering:
- **PowerShell**: Automating tasks, managing systems, and making the impossible possible.
- **Python**: Building robust scripts and developing creative automation solutions.
- **Terraform**: Harnessing the power of infrastructure as code to tame the cloud.
- **Homelabbing**: Creating, breaking, and rebuilding home lab environments to push the boundaries of learning.

### Projects and Interests
I’m passionate about sharing my journey and insights through my blog, where I dive into topics like:
- **Automation tools and techniques**: From PowerShell modules to rest api's.
- **Scripting best practices**: Writing clean, efficient, and reusable code (or at least trying :D).
- **Adaptive Cards and Actionable Messages**: Exploring how to create interactive emails and workflows.

Some of my recent blog posts include:

Let’s connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mortenmynster/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/Mynster9361) ! I’m always excited to meet like-minded professionals and exchange ideas.

## Description
This session will explore how to leverage the Actionable Messages module to create and send Adaptive Cards in Outlook using PowerShell. Attendees will learn how to design interactive cards, integrate them with Microsoft Graph API, and automate workflows for approvals, surveys, and notifications.

The session will include practical examples, such as:
- Creating server monitoring alerts
- Application usage surveys
- IT resource requests

These examples showcase the flexibility and power of Adaptive Cards in streamlining communication and decision-making processes.
